                I had never participated in a Startup Weekend, and decided to try my first Startup Weekend at Startup Weekend Beijing, despite not being fluent in Mandarin by any stretch of the imagination (pro tip: when words fail, there's always doodling).
              </p>
              <p>My team created an app, Zhongzhi, that <strong>connects people with good causes.</strong> And we came in 2nd place.</p>

              <h4>Who are our stakeholders?</h4>
              <p>We identified two kinds of stakeholders: 1) volunteers and 2) NGOs. Then we hit the road to interview potential users.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Stakeholder #1: Volunteers</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                After conducting our interviews, we concluded that the biggest barrier that stopped people from volunteering was <strong>lack of time</strong> and <strong>lack of information about available opportunities</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Stakeholder #2: NGOs</strong>
              </p>
              <p>The biggest pain point for NGOs was that <strong>they couldn't find people with the right skills at the right time</strong>.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='row'>
            <div class='col-sm-12'>
              <h2>Our Solution</h2>
              <p>We decided to create a <strong>mobile app that connects volunteers with nonprofit gigs</strong>.</p>
              <p>Why mobile? We wanted to maximize convenience for both volunteers and NGOs, and everyone in China is glued to their phones anyway.</p>
              <p>Designing for a Chinese audience was an interesting challenge as Chinese users are accustomed to UIs that are crammed with information, with very small text and icons. I spent a lot of time poring through apps like Taobao, WeChat, AliPay, so that I could make screens that felt intuitive for our target audience to use.</p>
              <p>These are the screens that we came up with.</p>

              <h4>Home</h4>
              <p>
                If you open Chinese apps on your phone, this is pretty typical of what you'd see.
              </p>
              <p>The circular icons allow volunteers to filter the kinds of activities they want to engage in.</p>
              <p>The rectangles are sorting filters - users can sort by duration of project, or by distance from where the user is.</p>

            <div class='col-sm-5 writeup'>
              <h4>Activity Detail</h4>
              <p>We wanted to show how easy and convenient it is for people to volunteer, so we showed the following data:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Date of activity</li>
                <li>Duration of activity (i.e. 1 hr of translation work, 1 day of volunteering at a children's home)</li>
                <li>Location of activity</li>
                <li>Distance from user's current location</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The green call to action button at the bottom opens up a Contact form that allows people to indicate their interest in the volunteer gig.</p>

              <h4>Nonprofit Organization Profile</h4>

              <p>It was definitely an interesting challenge, and our team came in 2nd! You can read the writeup <a href="http://mikesblog.com/2014/08/rocked-beijing-startup-weekend-beijing-fun-success-video.html">here</a>.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Jessica and I worked on a startup idea over the course of Startupweekend Beijing (we made 2nd place!). Jessica has been phenomenal to draft the visualization of the idea and design it as the only UX designer on the team. Everyone loved her design! Not only was her work beautiful and exactly what we brainstormed, but she was also an absolute pleasure and fun to work with despite the time pressure and limited resources we had available. I can only strongly recommend her</p>
